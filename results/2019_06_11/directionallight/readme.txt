In this directory there are 3 renderings made with a directional light source.
The difference between the pictures are the power of the directional light source.
lowpower - 8.0
highpower - 8000
veryhighpower - 8.000.000.000

The goal is to see if dual scattering is working. 
It seems that light is propagating farther into the volume when the directional light power increases.
However, since only around 15% of light is propagated, it is easy to see that light is quickly fading out.
